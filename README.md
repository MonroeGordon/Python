# Projects
This repository contains smaller projects I have completed or I am working on.

kerasnn.py - a small Keras neural network program that uses the pima-indians-diabetes.csv dataset that I've included in the repository. Currently, you can save the current neural network model to a file as well as train the model and have it make predictions. The model only uses the current dataset I've provided. The dataset can also be viewed in this program.
